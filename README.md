Mano a Mano
=========

WordPress site for the Mano a Mano charity. This site is periodically updated by volunteers. To setup locally:

-Clone the source
-Install a LAMP stack. I recommend [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)
-Symlink the *src* directory into the *htdocs* directory of XAMPP
-Create a MySql database and import the extract (you probably got an extract via email)
-Create a *wp-config.php* file in *src* that targets your environment (you probably got a sample via email)
-Start a browser and hit localhost/{*} to verify
